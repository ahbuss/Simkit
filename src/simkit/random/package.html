  <body>
    <p>A collection of Classes used to generate Random Numbers and Random
Variates. The Classes are typically instantiated using one of the two
factory Classes: RandomNumberFactory and RandomVariateFactory. The 
generation of random variates by the
implementations of RandomVariate are supported by an
instance of RandomNumber. Any
of the implementations of RandomNumber can be specified as the supporter
for the RandomVariates.</p>
