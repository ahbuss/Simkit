The SimkitXML2Java class translates simkit.xsd or simkit.dtd files into Java classes.

This class uses JAXB XML Bindings for Java based on simkit.xsd which is in turn
generated from simkit.dtd.

Note: some of the test files do not have the simkit.xsd or simkit.dtd placed in
an absolute path, so to run this with those test cases, simkit.dtd has been placed
here relatively, but should not be condidered the dtd for code generation. 

See simkit/xml for code generation of the JAXB for details.

To run, see sample run script. The class may also be used by other classes.

The Java Web Services Developer Kit 1.3 jars included in the lib directory
should be in the classpath to compile, generate bindings, and run the translator;
see SOURCE_ME, which should be customized for your environment.
