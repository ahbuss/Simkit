    <H2>Combat Modeling Assemblies</H2>
    <p>This is an experimental package that may eventually replace smdx as
    the foundational structure for combat modeling using simkit.</p.
    <p>The aim of this design is provide a more flexible architecture for
    assembling simulation entities by making heavy use of the Strategy and
    Builder design patterns --- i.e. show a strong preference for object
    composition over inheritance.  Simkit in general, and smdx in particular,
    pioneered the notion of lose coupling between simulation entities by leveraging
    the Listener (and Observer) pattern and the Adapter patern.  Here, we hope to
    further decouple things to enhance and simplify the creation and integration
    of new simulation entity behaviors.</p>
    <p>The paradigm shift is centered on two notions:</p>
    <ol><li>that the main programmming
    activity when making new simulation applications will be the creation of
    builder objects that assemble and parameterize existing generic entities in
    interesting ways.  When new behavior classes are needed, implying new
    kinds of interactions, it is incumbant on the author to make builders that
    assemble entities with those behaviors in ways that work.</li>
    <li>When figuring out what an object is, we prefer patterns that do not rely
    on whether an it implements an interface (that is,
    whether it 'isa' something), but instead we rely on whether it provides a
    behavior (that is, whether it 'hasa' something.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Behaviors are categorized, and looked up by string-valued keys.  This allows
    new behavior categories to be invented and integrated without impacting the
    design of the core generic entities.  If an entity has no implementing
    behavior for a category, it should silently ignore requests for that behavior
    (though a log message may be generated).  This allows, for example, finding
    all entities in a model that implement a particular behavior in a particular
    way.</p>
